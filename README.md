# Arc Randomizer
## Prerequisites
- [ARCropolis 3.3.0 or higher](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis/releases/latest)
- [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline/releases/tag/beta)

## Setup
Download the latest version of this plugin and put it in:
`sd:/atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins`

## Usage
Create a folder called `Randomizer` in the following path:

`sd:/ultimate/`

Inside the Randomizer folder, create a parent folder for the group of mods you want to randomize
```
- sd
  - ultimate
    - Randomizer
      - Final Destination Mods
```
then put the mods in there. So in the end, it should look something like this
```
- sd
  - ultimate
    - Randomizer
      - Final Destination Mods
        - Rainbow FD
        - WoLFD
        - Dark Final Destination
        - ....
```
You can have multiple parent and child folders.

### Warning: If your mod uses file addition, make sure that mod is in `sd:/ultimate/mods` and is enabled!
